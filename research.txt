​After reviewing the GitHub repository on audio deepfake detection , I've identified three promising forgery detection approaches suitable for detecting AI-generated human speech, with potential for real-time analysis of real conversations:​

1.Voice Spoofing Countermeasure for Logical Access Attacks Detection

Key Technical Innovation: Utilizes Extended Local Ternary Patterns (ELTP) combined with Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC) for feature extraction, and employs a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DBiLSTM) network for classification.​
Reported Performance Metrics: Achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.74% and a tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) of 0.008 in the Logical Access (LA) scenario.​
Why Promising: The exceptionally low EER and t-DCF indicate high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time detection of AI-generated speech in live conversations.​
Potential Limitations or Challenges: The model's performance in real-world, noisy environments needs further validation, and its computational requirements for real-time processing should be assessed.​


2.Replay and Synthetic Speech Detection with Res2Net Architecture

Key Technical Innovation: Employs Constant-Q Transform (CQT) for feature extraction and integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Res2Net50 (SE-Res2Net50) architecture for enhanced feature representation and classification.​
Reported Performance Metrics: Achieves an EER of 2.50% and a t-DCF of 0.074 in the LA scenario.​
Why Promising: The model's architecture effectively captures both local and global feature information, which is beneficial for detecting subtle artifacts in AI-generated speech, potentially enabling near real-time detection.​
Potential Limitations or Challenges: The approach may require significant computational resources, and its adaptability to diverse audio formats and languages should be evaluated.​



3.End-to-End Anti-Spoofing with RawNet2

Key Technical Innovation: Processes raw audio waveforms directly using the RawNet2 architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted feature extraction and simplifying the detection pipeline.​
Reported Performance Metrics: Achieves an EER of 1.12% and a t-DCF of 0.033 in the LA scenario.​
Why Promising: Directly analyzing raw audio data reduces preprocessing overhead, facilitating faster and potentially real-time detection of synthetic speech.​
Potential Limitations or Challenges: The model's robustness against various types of audio manipulations and its generalization to different datasets require further investigation.​


These approaches demonstrate significant potential for real-time detection of AI-generated human speech in conversational contexts. However, practical implementation would necessitate considerations regarding computational efficiency, adaptability to diverse audio inputs, and performance in real-world scenarios.
