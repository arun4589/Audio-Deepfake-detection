Selected Approach:
I will implement the End-to-End Anti-Spoofing with RawNet2 approach because it directly processes raw audio waveforms, reducing preprocessing overhead and enabling faster detection. This is crucial for real-time or near real-time applications. Additionally, its reported performance metrics (EER of 1.12% and t-DCF of 0.033) are promising.


Dataset Selection:
I will use the ASVspoof 2019 LA (Logical Access) dataset as it contains synthetic and genuine speech samples, making it suitable for training and evaluating anti-spoofing systems.
Dataset Link: ASVspoof 2019

The GitHub repository for audio deepfake detection also lists other datasets, which we may utilize if needed:

Implementation Steps:
1.Environment Setup:

Install necessary libraries: tensorflow, librosa, numpy, scipy, etc.
Download and prepare the ASVspoof 2019 dataset.

2.Data Preprocessing:

Load raw audio files directly using librosa.
Normalize and resample audio as needed.
Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.

3.Model Architecture:

Implement or adapt the RawNet2 architecture.
Use the raw waveform as input, avoiding handcrafted feature extraction.
Add layers for convolution and residual connections to capture complex patterns.
Integrate batch normalization and dropout to mitigate overfitting.

4.Training Configuration:

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy.
Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4.
Metrics: Accuracy and Equal Error Rate (EER).
Use callbacks like early stopping and model checkpointing.

5.Training and Fine-tuning:

Perform training with the ASVspoof 2019 dataset.
Conduct light fine-tuning using a subset of synthetic audio to improve robustness.


6.Evaluation and Comparison:

Evaluate the model on a hold-out test set.
Compare the obtained metrics with the reported ones.
Analyze the computational efficiency and detection time for real-time applications.
